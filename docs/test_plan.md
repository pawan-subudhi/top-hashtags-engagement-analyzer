# Test Plan

## Introduction

The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing strategy for the Top Hashtags Engagement Analyzer. The testing process will include various levels such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure the reliability and functionality of the software.

## Testing Objectives

1. Validate the correctness of individual components through unit testing.
2. Verify the interaction between components through integration testing.
3. Ensure the overall system functions as expected through system testing.
4. Identify and resolve any defects or issues before deployment.

## Test Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Objective:

- Validate the functionality of individual units or components.

#### Methods:

- Utilize a testing framework (e.g., pytest) to create and execute unit tests.
- Test critical functions, methods, and modules.

#### Responsibilities:

- Developers are responsible for creating unit tests for their respective components.

#### Criteria for Success:

- All unit tests pass without errors.

### 2. Integration Testing

#### Objective:

- Verify the correct interaction between integrated components.

#### Methods:

- Test the interaction between components within the same module or across modules.
- Evaluate the flow of data between integrated components.

#### Responsibilities:

- Developers and Testers collaborate to design and execute integration tests.

#### Criteria for Success:

- All integration tests pass without errors.

### 3. System Testing

#### Objective:

- Validate the end-to-end functionality and behavior of the entire system.

#### Methods:

- Test the complete system under different scenarios.
- Evaluate the system's performance, security, and usability.

#### Responsibilities:

- Testing team leads the execution of system tests.

#### Criteria for Success:

- The system meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected.

## Defect Management

- Defects will be logged using a tracking tool (e.g., Jira).
- Developers are responsible for fixing identified defects promptly.

## Sign-off

The testing team will provide a sign-off once all test levels are successfully completed, and the software is deemed ready for deployment.
